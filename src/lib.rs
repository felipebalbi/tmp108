//! This is a platform-agnostic Rust driver for the TMP108 temperature sensor
//! based on the [`embedded-hal`] traits.
//!
//! [`embedded-hal`]: https://docs.rs/embedded-hal
//!
//! For further details of the device architecture and operation, please refer
//! to the official [`Datasheet`].
//!
//! [`Datasheet`]: https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/tmp108
//!
//! # Operational notes
//!
//! ## I²C bus ownership
//!
//! The driver assumes single-master ownership of the TMP108. Several
//! methods (notably `configure`, `one_shot`, and `shutdown` on both
//! [`Tmp108`] and [`AsyncTmp108`]) perform a read-modify-write on the
//! configuration register as two distinct I²C transactions. On a
//! multi-master bus, a second master writing to register `0x01`
//! between the read and the write will silently lose those writes —
//! the TMP108 has no register-level lock. In multi-master designs,
//! serialise driver access at a higher level (e.g. a bus mutex around
//! the entire driver, not just individual I²C transactions).
//!
//! ## Driver lifecycle on drop
//!
//! Dropping a [`Tmp108`], [`AsyncTmp108`] or [`AlertTmp108`] does
//! **not** change the chip's operating mode. The chip retains whatever
//! `M` bits were last written. If you want the chip to stop drawing
//! current after the driver goes out of scope, call
//! [`Tmp108::shutdown`] or [`AsyncTmp108::shutdown`] (or finish an
//! [`AsyncTmp108::continuous`] call cleanly) before dropping.
//!
//! In particular, dropping the future returned by
//! [`AsyncTmp108::continuous`] mid-flight (e.g. via
//! `embassy_futures::select!` or `tokio::time::timeout`) leaves the
//! chip in `Mode::Continuous` indefinitely. See the cancel-safety note
//! on that method.

/// [`Wait`][2] contract states that an edge wait does **not** return
/// for an already-active pin: `wait_for_falling_edge` on a pin that is
/// already low "does *not* return immediately, it'll wait for the pin
/// to go high and then low again". Edges that occurred before the wait
/// was armed are therefore not guaranteed to be replayed, and a driver
/// that waits for one after having already acknowledged the chip can
/// wait forever.
///
/// (This supersedes section H1 of
/// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-tmp108-reliability-fixes-design.md`,
/// which claimed the `Wait` trait retains pending edges between calls.
/// See
/// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-tmp108-issue-59-alert-wait-ordering-design.md`
/// section 9.1. The rest of that earlier design stands.)
///
/// Reading the configuration register is not a side-effect-free status
/// query: per TMP108 datasheet SBOS663A §7.5.3.4, it clears both the
/// FL/FH flags and the ALERT pin. The waiter first checks for a retained
/// interrupt delivery from an earlier call. If one exists, it performs
/// **only one temperature read**: no configuration read, GPIO wait, or
/// acknowledgment. Otherwise it starts a **fresh acquisition**. In
/// Interrupt mode, that entry configuration read captures FL/FH; either
/// flag makes it proceed to temperature without GPIO or a second
/// acknowledgment. Only a clear entry snapshot leads to an asserted-level
/// wait followed by a second configuration read acknowledging that alert.
///
/// The chip's `Polarity` (active-low vs active-high) is read from the
/// configuration register on each fresh acquisition, not on retained
/// delivery attempts.
/// Do **not** reconfigure polarity while a `wait_for_temperature_threshold`
/// future is pending — the awaiting future will continue to wait for the
/// old polarity while the chip's ALERT output follows the new one.
///
/// On a fresh Comparator-mode acquisition the ALERT pin remains asserted
/// as long as the temperature is outside the `[TLow + HYS, THigh − HYS]` band; calling
/// `wait_for_temperature_threshold` in a tight loop while the chip is
/// still over-temperature will return immediately on every iteration
/// (because [`wait_for_low`][3] / [`wait_for_high`][4] return
/// immediately when the pin is already at the requested level). For
/// repeated-trigger workflows prefer Interrupt mode, or apply
/// application-level backoff between iterations. Fresh Comparator acquisition
/// never consults FL/FH and never performs a post-wait acknowledgment.
///
/// # Retained interrupt delivery
///
/// After a successful interrupt acknowledgment, the wrapper records a
/// **delivery obligation** before awaiting temperature. This applies both
/// to the entry-flag fast path and to the post-wait acknowledgment, whose
/// flags supply direction when nonzero but never requalify the event: a
/// zero-flag acknowledgment still arms the obligation, with
/// [`AlertCause::Unknown`]. Temperature-read failure returns
/// [`Error::Bus`] and leaves the obligation pending; cancellation during
/// that read also leaves it pending. A successful temperature read clears
/// it synchronously, with no intervening await, before returning `Ok`.
/// There is no internal retry: each delivery attempt reads temperature once.
///
/// [`wait_for_alert`][Self::wait_for_alert] and
/// [`wait_for_temperature_threshold`][1] are two views of **one
/// consumptive stream**, not two subscribers: they share this single
/// obligation. Either may arm it, and a successful delivery through
/// either settles it. The trait deliberately discards the cause, so a
/// cause consumed by a successful scalar delivery cannot be retrieved
/// afterwards.
///
/// The obligation survives [`sensor_mut`][Self::sensor_mut], direct
/// temperature reads, and reconfiguration. **Retained delivery takes
/// precedence over the current mode**, even after switching to Comparator
/// mode. Fresh Comparator acquisition never creates an obligation.
///
/// Retention is wrapper-local: [`into_inner`][Self::into_inner],
/// [`destroy`][Self::destroy], or dropping the wrapper abandons it without
/// driver I/O. Re-wrapping starts empty; it does not restore this state.
///
/// **Liveness:** with a retained obligation and a permanently failing bus
/// that returns immediately, a loop awaiting this method receives an
/// immediately-ready `Err` each time and need not yield. Callers must
/// provide their own backoff or bounded retries.
///
/// # What the returned temperature is
///
/// [`wait_for_temperature_threshold`][1] returns the **latest
/// conversion**, read from the temperature register *after* an alert
/// was observed. It is not a sample captured at the moment the
/// threshold was crossed, and the driver does not retain one.
/// A retained delivery is a debt, **not a cached sample**: its temperature
/// is read at retry time. There is no bound on the time since the crossing,
/// nor on the age of the conversion in the register. The value may be
/// outside or inside the band; it does not reconstruct the historical event.
///
/// Consequently:
///
/// - the value need not equal the temperature that triggered the alert;
/// - it can be back inside the configured `[TLow + HYS, THigh − HYS]`
///   band, which is normal when a latched interrupt is delivered after
///   the excursion ended, and is **not** grounds to treat the
///   notification as spurious;
/// - it cannot identify whether FL, FH, or both caused the event. The
///   chip can set both flags, and it coalesces multiple excursions into
///   one latched state. Comparing the returned value against the limits
///   is a heuristic, not a receipt. Use
///   [`wait_for_alert`][Self::wait_for_alert], which reports the
///   observed [`AlertCause`] alongside the sample, instead of inferring
///   direction from the temperature.
///
/// Reading the configuration register acknowledges the interrupt before
/// the temperature transaction is even issued, so the acknowledgment is
/// never contingent on the temperature read succeeding.
///
/// # Errors and cancellation
///
/// This operation is **not event-delivery cancel-safe**, and its error
/// type cannot express a partially completed event delivery. Callers
/// that need durable, exactly-once threshold notifications require a
/// separate delivery design — one this driver does not currently
/// provide. Failure or cancellation during the entry or acknowledging
/// configuration read can consume hardware evidence before the driver
/// records an obligation; no caller-side retry or queue can reconstruct
/// that lost evidence. Only the subsequent temperature stage is retryable.
/// Relatching or sustained Comparator assertion can still produce more
/// than one `Ok` for a single physical excursion.
///
/// Specifically:
///
/// - A configuration read may acknowledge an interrupt — clearing the
///   chip's FL/FH and releasing ALERT — *before* this call returns.
///   That acknowledgment is not undone on any failure path.
/// - [`Error::Bus`] does not identify which transaction failed: the
///   entry configuration read, the post-wait acknowledgment, or the
///   temperature read. It also does **not** prove that the interrupt
///   survived, nor that no interrupt occurred. An error must never be
///   read as "nothing happened".
/// - Cancelling this future — by dropping it, or by racing it against a
///   timeout or a `select!` — during a configuration read can consume an
///   event unrecoverably, without returning a temperature or an error.
///   Cancellation during a retained interrupt's temperature read instead
///   preserves the delivery obligation. No asynchronous cleanup runs on
///   drop; in particular no cleanup configuration read is performed,
///   because such a read would itself consume a later event.
/// - Retrying with a retained delivery performs temperature only. Without
///   an obligation, retrying starts a **fresh observation**. If an entry
///   or acknowledging read consumed the latch without returning success,
///   that fresh retry may wait indefinitely for a different event.
/// - Whether the bus and the pin are usable after cancellation depends
///   entirely on the underlying HAL's cancellation and recovery
///   guarantees for an in-flight I2C transaction or GPIO wait. The
///   driver makes no additional promise here.
/// - The returned sample is current register data, **not** a
///   trigger-time sample and not a receipt identifying a threshold
///   direction.
///
/// ## Recovery contract, by phase — Interrupt mode
///
/// The table below applies to **interrupt acquisition and retained
/// interrupt delivery**, including delivery after reconfiguration to
/// Comparator mode. Only Interrupt mode latches FL/FH and consumes an
/// event on a configuration read. Recovery differs by *where* the call
/// stopped, and in two of the four phases the driver cannot tell you
/// whether an event was consumed:
///
/// | Stopped at | Consumed? | What a caller may assume |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | Entry configuration read | **Unknown** | The chip may or may not have latched, and may or may not have been acknowledged before the failure. Treat any pending event as possibly lost. |
/// | GPIO level wait ([`Error::Pin`]) | **Nothing** | No acknowledgment was performed after the entry read. A still-latched event remains visible to the next call's entry snapshot. |
/// | Post-wait acknowledgment | **Unknown** | ALERT was observed asserted, but whether the acknowledging read reached the chip is not determinable from the error. |
/// | Temperature read (initial or retained attempt) | **Definitely acknowledged** | Hardware flags are gone, but delivery remains pending after failure or cancellation. Retrying on this wrapper reads temperature once, with no configuration read, GPIO wait, or acknowledgment, even after switching to Comparator mode. |
///
/// ## Recovery contract — Comparator mode
///
/// This section applies to **fresh Comparator acquisition**, with no
/// retained interrupt delivery. Comparator mode has no latch and no
/// acknowledgment: the entry configuration read is used solely to learn the configured mode and
/// polarity, no FL/FH is consulted, and there is deliberately no
/// post-wait acknowledging read. Consequently **nothing is ever
/// consumed** on this path, and none of the "evidence is gone" rows
/// above apply.
///
/// On this fresh Comparator path, a retry after any failure — including
/// a temperature-read failure after the level wait succeeded — performs a fresh
/// *level observation*. If the temperature is still outside the
/// `[TLow + HYS, THigh − HYS]` band, ALERT is still asserted, and the
/// retry may legitimately complete immediately for the **same
/// continuously asserted condition**, with no new threshold crossing
/// having occurred. Callers must therefore not treat a completed
/// comparator-mode call as evidence of a distinct event, nor treat a
/// failed one as evidence that a condition was consumed and can no
/// longer be observed. Conversely, if the temperature has returned
/// inside the band in the meantime, ALERT is released and the retry
/// will wait for the next excursion.
///
/// Returning from this method — and thus releasing the `&mut self`
/// borrow — only permits a subsequent Rust call. It establishes nothing
/// about the hardware: it does not mean the chip has settled, that
/// ALERT has been released, or that a new conversion has occurred.
